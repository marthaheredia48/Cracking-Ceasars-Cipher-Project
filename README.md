# Cracking Caesar's Cipher

**Cracking Caesar's Cipher** is a Python program designed to crack Caesar ciphers by trying all possible key values. This project was developed during the **Girls Who Code Self-Paced Program 2023**.

## Overview

The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and oldest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places down or up the alphabet. This program helps in decrypting a message that has been encrypted using the Caesar cipher by trying all possible keys and displaying the results.

## Features

- **Decrypts Messages**: Given an encrypted message, the program tries all possible key values and prints each possible decryption.
- **Handles All Characters**: The program can process letters, numbers, and symbols, maintaining their original form in the output.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: The user provides the encrypted message.
2. **Processing**: The program cycles through all possible key values (0-93) and attempts to decrypt the message using each key.
3. **Output**: The program prints out all decrypted messages, one for each key, allowing the user to identify the correct plaintext.
